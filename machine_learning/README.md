This is the part to predict the smartphone price based on a given feature. There are still some preprocessing that must be done. The dataset that consist of units will be processed such as cleaning the unit, then convert the numbers that still in string into float. The data then divided based on categorical and numerical data. The categorical data will be one hot encoding, as for the numerical data will be left alone. Then both data will be combined into one again.

The combined data will then be separated into x and y dataset where the x will become the feature data and y will become the target, each of them will then be converted into numpy. The data then split into training and test data.

The data then scaled using minmax scaler for the predicting. After that created a model using Multilayer Perceptron Regression, a regression modern feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model that use nonlinear activation funtion. To test the data, created an input where the input using the given selected feature. The tested data which consists only one row, then gone through the same process as preprocessing which was done inside the code. The data then scaled using minmax scaler then predicted using MLPR. The result is shown below.
